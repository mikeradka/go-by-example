	// Unlike arrays, slices are typed only by the elements
	// they contain, not the number of elements. An
	// uninitialized slice equals to nil and has length 0.
	var s []string
	fmt.Println("uninit:", s, s == nil, len(s) == 0)

	// To create an empty slice with a non-zero length, use
	// the builtin 'make'. Here we make a slice of strings of
	// length 3 (initially zero-valued). By default a new
	// slice's capacity is equal to its length; if we know
	// the slice is going to grow ahead of time, it's possible
	// to pass a capacity explicitly as an additional
	// parameter to make.

	// In addition to these basic operations, slices support
	// several more that make them richer than arrays. One is
	// the builtin 'append', which returns a slice containing
	// one or more new values. Note that we need to accept a
	// return value from append as we may get a new slice value.
	s = append(s, "d")

	// slice c of the same length as s and copy into c from s.
	c := make([]string, len(s))
